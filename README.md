# EasyMorph dataset format
Open-source tools for reading EasyMorph dataset files (.dset).

[EasyMorph](https://easymorph.com) is a data preparation application designed for non-technical users. The .dset format is a data file format native to EasyMorph projects. Technically, it's a binary data file with columnar compression, where columns can mix values of different types - numbers, text, boolean, etc.

The repository contains:

  * The source code of an open-source library (C#, .NET Standard) for reading data from EasyMorph dataset files (.dset)
  * A command-line utility that converts a .dset file into a .csv file
  
You're welcome to post questions about the repository on the [EasyMorph Community forum](https://community.easymorph.com).
